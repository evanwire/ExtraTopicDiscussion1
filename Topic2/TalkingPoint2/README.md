# Good study strategies

Beyond taking notes, studying for a computer science exam can be a unique challenge. Due to structure of the content, general study strategies like flashcards will often not suffice. Here I'll go over some of the tactics I use to prepare for an exam.

Note that there are a few different types of information you will learn in your computer science classes. Each of these have different optimal study strategies. I'll go over my definitions of the various types of information, and how to study each of them, below:

**Vocabulary**
These are very atomic phrases with short, static definitions, such as "SDK." Additionally, this includes atomic processes, that serve one single purpose, such as the "ls" command.

These are the only things that I feel can be effectively studied using flash cards. However, these vocabulary terms often contribute towards bigger concepts, so studying these broader concepts will often transitively reinforce your understanding of the terms.

**Concepts**
Concepts are slightly broader vocabulary terms. These are essentially vocabulary terms that have multiple definitions and/or use cases. For instance, "recursion" is an example of a concept.

These are often too broad to consolidate on a flashcard. These are often more important than atomic vocabulary terms. I typically study concepts by watching youtube videos on them. Often, hearing these concepts explained by different people in different ways is a great method to gain a deeper understanding. Additionally, I study concepts through experimentation. If it is something that can be represented in code, I will open a text editor and simply mess around with it.

**Processes**
These are essentially multi-step instructions that achieve a certain goal. For instance, "Quick Sort" would be a process. Pretty much any algorithm could be considered a process, as well as things like "Creating a local instance of a remote repository."

These can often be studied through pictures. Any algorithm, which usually are applied to a data structure, can be represented in a series of drawings that correspond to each step of the process. Things like Git operations, that aren't applied to data structures, are best studied through practice. It is also worth noting that processes often have concepts or voculary attached to them, such as the efficiency of an algorithm. These can be studied by flash cards, although it is best to think about "why" when drawing/coding the algorithm. Also, I find that verbally speaking each step as I trace some code/look over a picture helps a lot.

**Topics**
Topics are essentially umberellas that contain several concepts and/or vocabulary terms. One example would be "Binary Search Trees." Within the topic of BST's, one could investigate many different algorithms, such as searching, insertion, deletion, etc.

Topics are broad and will often not be exclusively asked about on an exam. You will likely not be asked a question like "Name 3 different search algorithms one could perform on an array." However, defining topics is a great way to organize one's thoughts. Studying each BST search algorithm, while considering that each of the algorithms can be applied to BST's, will help you draw connections between different algorithms, vocabulary terms, etc.

## A real example of how I studied for an exam
For my final for Data Structures, a class I took in undergrad at Rutgers, there was a lot of content to study. There were many concepts, such as graphs, BST's, hash tables, etc. Within each topic, there were many processes, including searching, sorting, and insertion. Each process had certain concepts/vocab attached to them, such as each algorithm's runtime efficiency.

Over the course of the week leading up to the exam, I spent one day going over each topic. I broke each topic down into individual processes, and for each one, drew pictures of the algorithms. I then looked back at any code examples I had, and thought about how each image I drew corresponds to a line of code. This connection was crucial in allowing me to answer any coding questions on the exam. While I was doing this, I was also considering the efficiency of each algorithm and tried to justify the why.

I didnt' use a single flash card or reread/rewrite my notes. I did draw pictures, watched youtube videos, and spent a fair amount of time talking to myself.
