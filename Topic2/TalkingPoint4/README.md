# Best classes I (and any other TA's in the call) have taken

Keep in mind I went to Rutgers for my undergrad, so I will not list course numbers. There are, however, certainly equivalents to any course I took that could be taken at UW. This list is in order, from favorite to least favorite. Keep in mind my interests lie mainly in low-level systems, and I have little to no interest in things like machine learning or data science.

**Operating Systems**'
Amazing course, I reccomend everyone takes an OS course regardless of your interests. Learning how a computer works at a low level like this is incredibly valuable. While it is just generally interesting, the principles taught in this class will help you become a better programmer in general.

**Internet Technology**
This class was super interesting. The internet is quite a complex beast, and learning how it works is very rewarding. Additionally, the principles taught in this class are very industry-applicable, given the seemingly industry wide push towards cloud computing and distributed systems.

**Systems Programming**
At Rutgers, this class essentially served as an introduction to programming in C. However, this class was also a CS student's first introduction into concepts like memory management, the structure of processes and threads, and socket programming. The main reason I liked this class was because the projects were super interesting and rewarding.

**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**
While I have no interest in data science or ML, AI is undeniably an interesting concept. Studying intelligent algorithms is very valuable in many different fields, such as finance, game development, robotics, etc. 

**Computer Architecture**
I'll be honest, this class was objectively quite difficult. This is because it serves as an introduction to some hardware principles, which for people with a strong preference for software, can be quite jarring. However, learning about how processors work, how memory stored, and how data is stored in a binary format is incredibly interesting.

## Bonus: Fun programming languages to learn this winter break

### Languages
* **Rust:** A newer language, Rust is growing rapidly, with many people switching to it over other networking-focused languages like Go. It runs almost as fast as C++, and has so many interesting features that make programming quite refreshing.
* **JavaScript:** I personally prefer lower-level languages, but it is impossible to overlook how many different applications JS has. JS allows developers to develop apps, websites, server-side code, API's, and more, while maintaining a relatively easy to understand syntax.
* **C++:** Many people seem to think this language is dying due to the growth of languages like Python and JavaScript. However, C++ is still incredibly important, and is used in almost every dicipline. This is the standard for almost all low level systems, such as game engines, operating systems, and device drivers.
