# Useful and interesting books to read about computer science

Reading is absolutely one of the best ways to spend your free time. Authors are typically experts in some field, so learning directly from them is incredibly valuable. While CS is very technical, there are still some great reads I would suggest every student takes a look at.

**Pragmatic Thinking and Learning** *Andy Hunt*
While this book is not about computer science per-say, it is written for developers and contains a ton of valuable advice. This book is an interesting piece of meta cognition (thinking about one's thinking), where Hunt describes how people's brains are wired and how to take advantage of their architecture to effectively learn and retain information. This was written to help developers learn new things quicker, but can be applied to almost any class or subject. Plus, it is written in a very entertaining manner, making it an easy read.

**The Annotated Turing** *Charles Petzold*
This book definitely isn't for everyone. However, if you are interested in the history of computers, this is the book for you. This book annotates Turing's infamous paper *ON COMPUTABLE NUMBERS, WITH AN APPLICATION TO
THE ENTSCHEIDUNGSPROBLEM* which provides the basis of the entire field of computation. Additionally, Petzold provides historical context, information on Turing's contemporaries and influences, and a deep dive into the psychological concesequences of the theory of computer intelligence.

**Cracking the Coding Interview** *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*
This book is a godsend for anyone prepping for interview season. Written in Java, this book details many, if not all, of the content one might need to know on a coding interview. Additionally, McDowell provides many sample questions one might see on an interview. It is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their chances at getting a job in tech.

**Zero to One** *Peter Thiel*
Written by one of the most prominent names in tech (cofounder of PayPal and Palantir, and one of the first outside investors in Facebook), Thiel writes some incredibly valuable words describing how to start a successful startup. His philosophy can be summed up in this quote:

> It's easier to copy a model than to make something new: doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.

By going from 0 to 1, you own a monopoly. Thiel describes how to do this, with plenty of examples from his own experience.

**Algorithms to Live By** *Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths*
This book is an interesting bridge between computer science and psychology, explaining how the algorithms we learn in school can be used to solve simpley human problems. From how to organize a closet to finding a spouse, the authors do an amazing job of reinforcing the basic algorithms we all learn in school, while providing many shockingly fresh applications for each one.
