### How are blockchains private?
A key aspect of privacy in blockchains is the use of private and public keys. These keys are random strings of numbers and are cryptographically related. However, it is mathematically impossible for a user to guess another user's private key from their public key. This provides an increase in security and protects users from hackers. Public keys can be shared with other users in the network because they give away no personal data. Each user has an address that is derived from the public key using a hash function. These addresses are used to send and receive assets on the blockchain, such as cryptocurrency.

A somewhat decent privacy analogy is reddit. Let's say you create a reddit account with no relation to your name or anything, say AnonymousUser. Anyone on reddit could see what you have posted, and could send you messages. However, no one could see who you are. Also, no one would be able to forge messages on your behalf without your password, which is impossible to guess by just knowing your username. The only difference is that, on a blockchain, your reddit posts would be encrypted.
