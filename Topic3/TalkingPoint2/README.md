### Advantages of blockchains
* **They are distributed.** This means that one could perform transactions relatively quickly and cheaply with any member of a blockchain network, regardless of geographic location.
* **Bigtime Privacy.** One does not have to provide any personal information to exchange cryptocurrencies. In the ledger, one would only see a hash that is derived from your public key, which is not a security risk and cannot be tied to you in any way.
* **Transparency.** Blockchains are published to every node in the network. This means every transaction is subject to scrutiny, making it hard to forge or manipulate transactions.
