# CS400 Extra Topic Discussions

This repository hosts the information disucssed during CS400 extra topic sessions. Myself and other TA's will be hosting weekly discussions, where students can come and learn about industry applicable, useful, or simply interesting knowledge that would not typically be taught in a classroom. The schedule of topics is as follows:

* Nov 5: github.com
* Nov 12: Tips for Learning Computer Science
* Nov 19: 
* Nov 26: **We will not be meeting, Thanksgiving Holiday**
* Dec 3:
* Dec 10:


For the dates with no topics, some things I know well or think would be useful/interesting to talk about are:
* Web development
* How the internet works
* Tech interviews
* App development
* The pros and cons of each area within CS
* Ethics in computer science (VERY important these days)
* Blockchain
